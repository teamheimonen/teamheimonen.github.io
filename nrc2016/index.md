# Nordic Recumbent Championships 2016 in Finland

[Recumbent Racing Finland](http://rrfi.fi) hosts the **premiere** 
[Nordic Championships](http://rrfi.fi/nrc16) 
race for recumbents and velomobiles in the first weekend of August. The race location is
Nokian Tyres Test Track, Nokia, Finland.


Nordic Recumbent Championships (NRC) builds on the tradition of the Finnish Championships, 
an event which has been raced since 2011.
Some of the participants are the true pioneers of the recumbent scene in 
Nordics while others will be racing for the first time ever. 
Racing gear varies from amazing DIY contraptions to factory-made high-tech racers and protos.


It will be a jovial event, starting unofficially already in Friday evening, when the track is 
open for last minute tests and desperate tune-ups. The actual competition starts in Saturday with 
200 m and 1 hour time trial races, but there will also be some unofficial stuff going on, 
socializing, slowest rider competitions and test rides. The Sunday is the annual highlight for seasoned 
marathon riders, guys and girls testing their physical limits and determination
on 6 and 12 hour races. 

Even though the competition for the Nordic Championship title will be fierce, hopefully, 
everyone is welcome on the track. Many participants only race against themselves 
in a marathon event and take the opportunity to challenge their personal limits 
in a safe environment.

In the 12 hour event the average speed varies from 15 km/h to 60 km/h, so
you really don't need to be a hard core racer to participate - just come along and 
have a nice weekend riding on one of the hidden tracks in Finnish wilderness.

The event is open for everyone, regardless of nationality, but - obviously - you can 
race for the Nordic Championships title only if you are a citizen of a Nordic country.

You can also ride with a "normal" upright bicycle, if you don't have a recumbent. 
Upright bikes will have their own category. However, as the number of timing chips is
limited, organizer warns that they might need to limit the amount of upright bikes 
to guarantee that every recumbent can participate. 

One more thing: racing is not mandatory, curious audience is always welcome - free of charge!
