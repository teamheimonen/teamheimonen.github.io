## The attempt - One Hour Time Trial

* **Time**: Saturday, August 6th, 2016
* **Place**: Nokian Tyres Test Track, Nokia, Finland
* **Event**: 2016 Finnish Recumbent Championships
* **Organized by**: Recumbent Racing Finland ry
* **Timing authority**: Gerard Arends, Holland
* **WRRA class**: Trike (unfaired multitrack bicycle)
* **WRRA age group**: Masters (50 years and ticking)

The record attempt is done within a dedicated schedule slot between "public/open" 200 m and 1 hour races. 
The time trial will be photographed and filmed according to WRRA requirements, probably so that we'll have a car following 100 meters behind.

## About the hour record

>&quot;The hour record is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle from a stationary start. Cyclists attempt this record alone on the track without other competitors present. It is considered perhaps the most prestigious record in all of cycling. Over history, various cyclists ranging from unknown amateurs to well-known professionals have held the record, adding to its prestige and allure.&quot;

There are several records, the most famous of which is for upright bicycles meeting the requirements of 
the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). However, UCI rules do not accept recumbent bicyles nor tricycles at all. 
For recumbents, the records are ratified by World Recumbent Racing Association, WRRA. 


>&quot;Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.&quot;
