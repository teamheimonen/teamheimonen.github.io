Strokes are the fourth leading cause of death in men, immediately after heart disease, cancer and accidents.

>The consequences of a stroke can be devastating. Not only can a stroke kill you, but nonfatal strokes 
can leave you severely debilitated, paralyzed, or unable to communicate. However, 80% of all 
strokes are preventable.

Strokes are best prevented by controlling high blood pressure and exercising for at least half an hour on most days of the week.
Other preventive actions are eating right - a diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits and vegetables 
and maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and avoiding binge drinking.
