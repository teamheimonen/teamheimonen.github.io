## Background
I encountered my first stroke already eight years ago. I was 47 years old, feeling well and strong, 
doing weight training in the gym regularly, steadily building mass little by little. 
My blood pressure had been high for years, but I didn't really care, as I didn't feel sick at all. 
I hardly did any regular aerobic excercises, even my doctor had encouraged me to do so and take easier with the weights.

I hadn't thought about it, but I have inherited a "good" family history of strokes. My grand-father died
because of a stroke and my father had a stroke, which paralyzed his body's left side. Father did recover
quite well though, and he was 89 when he died. It seems that we have some kind of genetic fault, which can be seen
in blood analyzes, there's an anomaly in blood protein levels, trigly levels. 
It does not cause strokes, but it's just suspected to increase the risk of having one.

## First stroke

Eventually, I too got my first stroke. After that
I was hospitalized for one week, and when I left the hospital I was having weak left side in my body and some problems with balance.
And I was tired, increbibly tired. After six months I was so out of order, that just surviving daily work routine 
started to be a major challenge. 

## First Recovery

To get my life back and to recover, I somehow managed to start doing some cycling exercises. 
My friend suggested to exercise in the mornings, when I had at least some energy, on the indoor trainer.
What a wise advice it was. I remember how hard it was to keep going, but little by little things got better. 

Then, for some unexlicable reason, I bought a road bike and went nuts. My physical condition started improving quickly,
it motivated me to train more and more, I lost almost 10 kg of weight from my upper body and had to renew all my clothes.
Balance was the hardest thing to get back totally. I could ride a racing bicycle, but I had had to stop motorcycling and
high speed descents on a bicycle did not feel good at all. 

### Balance recovery

It took me four years before I felt that my sense of balance was totally normal. It did not happen by accident,
but with the aid of a indoor cycling training equipment, rollers. I have not read any recommendations of
using rollers as a post-stroke trainer, but wow, that was a huge improvement for me!

You need to have a decent physical condition before using rollers, so that you don't get too tired
when spinning. This means that you can't start your recovery on rollers, but I highly recommend
them if you have problems with balance.

When you start with rollers, you need to support yourself somehow and even then it's difficult. I remember thinking
that I'll never tackle the stuff, but miracles happen quickly - after sweating and feeling desperate for
first 20 - 30 minutes, I suddenly started to be able to keep myself upright. Next day it was easier and
maybe after a week or two it was already easy. Then after a few weeks of regular spinning on rollers, I could
watch movies while cycling on rollers. Next summer I realized that I was descending steep hills
comfortably, having no incertainty on switchbacks. Occasionally I could even pass other roadies on descents
during the local cyclesport events here in Alpes-Maritimes region in France. I wrote myself totally recovered.
 

### Second stroke

Even though I exercised regularly, I had started to have odd peaks in my blood pressure, if I was stressed,
didn't sleep enough or probably had been drinking too much. Also the effect of medication has started to
vanish a little bit, my body had got used to the medicines.
