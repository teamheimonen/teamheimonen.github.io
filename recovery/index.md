I encountered my first stroke already eight years ago. I was 47 years old and feeling well and strong, 
doing weight training in the gym regularly, building mass. 
My blood pressure had been high for years, but I didn't really care, as I didn't feel sick. 
I hardly did any aerobic excercises, even my doctor had encouraged to do so and take easier with the weights. 

But eventually, I got my warning. After the first stroke
I was hospitalized for one week, and when I left the hospital I was having weak left side in my body and some imbalance problems.
After six months I was so out of order, that surviving daily work routine started to be a major challenge. 
To get my life back and to recover, I managed to start doing some cycling exercises, first in the mornings, when I had at least some energy, on the indoor trainer. 
I remember how hard it was to find the energy, but little by little things got better. 
Then, for some unexlicable reason, I bought a road bike and went nuts. My physical condition started improving quickly,
it motivated me to train more and more, I even lost almost 10 kg of weight - had to renew all my clothes.
