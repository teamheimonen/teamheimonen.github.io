On Sunday morning the legs were tired, so I decided to take it very easy, no intervals, just low 
heartrate easy cruising. It seems that new riding position needs some adaptation before the legs
and body start behaving "normally". Nevertheless I rode 60 km and climbed almost 800 m, a decent ride.

There's one benefit when riding easily: no reason to avoid stops, so any attraction becomes a photo opportunity.

First stop in the Gorges du Loup, at the village of Pont du Loup.
