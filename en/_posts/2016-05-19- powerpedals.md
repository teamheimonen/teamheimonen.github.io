Look was the first manufacturer that introduced clipless pedals in 1984 and ever since Look Keo
has been one of the most popular road bike pedal. Now, in 2016, they have introduced the second generation
of their power meter pedals, Keo Power. 

These new Keo Power pedals are ANT+ compatible and they do look cool with their positively sharp color scheme.
They also look very *aerodynamic*, specifically very *"recumbent aerodynamic"* as the bottom part of the
pedals is more or less totally closed, which potentially is very beneficial considering the fact that the shoe 
orientation on recumbents is "bottom forward".

Pedal based power metering allows measuring the left-right leg balance, which is especially
beneficial for people like me who have muscle coordination problems or are recovering from accidents.
I'm also looking forward to being able to fine tune my riding position by analyzing
the power, heart rate and speed figures after the test rides on track. 
With all that information a lot of questimation will be avoided.
