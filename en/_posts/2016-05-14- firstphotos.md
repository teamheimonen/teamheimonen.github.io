Finally received the trike on Thursday, assembled it in the evening and made some 30 kms of test rounds on Cannes bike ring 
on Friday evening. Today I rode the first 70 km on road, including some moderate hills and took some photos. 

I have not yet found the optimal 
seat adjustments, and some aerodynamic tweaking needs to be done, but one thing is sure: this thing is certainly faster than 
anything I have ridden before. I'm really excited!

Anyways, the photos are below. Hope you like them.
