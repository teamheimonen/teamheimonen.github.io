## World record, trike one hour time trial

Sorry about the long silence in the blog, the record attempt really took place as planned
on 6th August. It was successful, I set the new World Record, 591 meters better than 
the previous one, which had been recorded one month earlier in Germany.

### THANK YOU ALL !

The record is offically ratified by WRRA and can be found from their site:
