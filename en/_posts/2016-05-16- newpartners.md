Velosport and LOOK have joined to the Teamheimonen project, which means that the grand time trial champion Raimo 
will advice me on training and race preparation. This will obviously be a remarkable benefit for the project!

Velosport is the official LOOK importer in Finland, which means that the high end cycling products from LOOK will
be put into use during my training and the race itself.
