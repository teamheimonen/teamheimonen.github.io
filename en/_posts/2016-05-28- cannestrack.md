On last Friday evening I went to Cannes "Louison Bobet" cycling track for training and testing 170 mm cranks.
This is a 850 meters long triangular and asphalt surfaced, non-covered cycling circuit 
with a small incline/decline. A bit windy, but otherwise very nice "soiree".

Some photographs from the session:
