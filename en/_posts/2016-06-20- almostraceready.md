Trike is slowly aproaching the final race appearance, or should I say the final appearance for this year.
I think I've found a pretty good and comfortable riding position, which should be quite decent aerodynamically, too.

First reality check and real test will be the 2016 World Championships at Amsterdam 2nd and 3rd of July, only 
two weeks to go!
 
It seems that I need to manufacture some kind of front chainwheel protection, chainguard - required by
the race organizer for safety reasons. I've planned a lightweight and aerodynamically fluid carbon construction, but we'll see what happens.
