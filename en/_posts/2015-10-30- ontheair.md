It seems that I managed to get this site up and running ahead of schedule. While looking for
and selecting a hosted platform for website with blogging features, I ended up using Jekyll and Github, 
which requires little bit of coding when setting things up, but should provide a rock-solid simple 
static website without any dynamic hassles (like database).

Jekyll is a powerful ‘static site generator’ that uses Ruby to generate your site from text files.

    Warning, this is non-speak area for geeks

    The workflow with Jekyll and Github suits me well, 
    it's quite familiar workflow with integrated 
    version control: write --- test locally --- commit and push. 
    And it's published *immediately* after 'git push'.
