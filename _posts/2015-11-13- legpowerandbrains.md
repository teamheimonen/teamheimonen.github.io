A colleague sent me an interesting link, which claims that leg power is the ultimate goodie for your brain! It's one more reason to keep on riding, 
keep on moving through whatever obstacles may rise. 

A scientifial study executed by researchers at Kingâ€™s College London, using a sample of 324 identical twins tells that: 

>&quot;A striking protective relationship was found between muscle fitness (leg power) and both 10-year 
>cognitive change and subsequent total grey matter. Leg power predicts both cognitive ageing and global brain structure.&quot;
